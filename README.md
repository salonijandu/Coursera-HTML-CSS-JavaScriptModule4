# Coursera-HTML-CSS-JavaScriptModule4

Module 4 Coding Assignment
Coursera course: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers

Let's write a little bit of Javascript programming code to practice what we've learned! Woohoo! :-)

Time to complete: About 30 minutes.

Ask questions in Discussions if you get stuck! We are all learning, and going through getting stuck and then unstuck (even with someone's help) can be a very valuable learning experience!

Summary: In this assignment, you are going to loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.

However, in order to do that printing you will have to use 2 externally provided libraries whose code is not 100% ready to be used. Using the things we've learned in this module, your job will be to fix the code in those libraries.

You will get some starter code to work with where all the steps of what you need to do are clearly spelled out for you.
